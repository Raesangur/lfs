# lfs

My attempt at building Linux From Scratch (and maybe Beyond Linux From Scratch)
I'm following version 11.1 of the instructions located at:
https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/

This repo contains multiple setup scripts, as well as links to repos containing source code to download and build.
These scripts are not completely plug & play, and I bear no responsibility in breaking your system if you run them and they break something, most importantly disk partitionning & formatting.
